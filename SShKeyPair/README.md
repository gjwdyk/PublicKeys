# Public SSh KeyPairs

Contents of this subsection are SSh private and public keys.
They're usually needed so that one OS-Unit or node can send instructions/commands to the other, using scripts.
***Important note*** that the SSh keys can be used to gain access to your machines or instances.
Therefore it is ***absolutely recommended*** that you use SSh keys which you [create by yourself](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html), and that you keep that (newly created) SSh keys confidential for yourself only.
Also ensure that your machines/instances are NOT reachable by any un-trusted party/entity such as public Internet.
